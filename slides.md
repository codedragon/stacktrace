# The Stacktrace

## Maria Mckinley



## Let's make a fancy cake

## Basic cake instructions:
* make meringue
* make buttercream
* make chantilly
* assemble




## Each step consists of more steps

### for example make buttercream consists of:
* make syrup
* whisk egg yolks
* whisk syrup into egg yolks




### and of course make syrup has a couple of steps:
* In a high-sided saucepan over medium heat, add the coffee and sugar. 
* Set a candy or deep-fat thermometer into the pan and heat until the mixture registers 265Â°.




# Code is instructions for a computer
# like a recipe is instructions for a cook




## We are making the syrup for the buttercream
## A stack is a list of the steps we have started, but not completed so far:

* make cake
* make buttercream
* make syrup

make buttercream is not there, because we finished making the buttercream.
make chantilly isn't there, because we have not started making the chantilly.




## What happens if something goes wrong while making the syrup? 
## We end up with a stack as shown above:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "make_cake.py", line 15, in <module>
    make_cake(ingredients)
  File "make_cake.py", line 3, in make_cake
    buttercream=make_buttercream(syrup, egg_yolks)
  File "make_cake.py", line 9, in make_buttercream
    syrup=make_syrup(coffee, sugar) 
  File "make_cake.py", line 13, in make_syrup
    add_sugar(salt)
TypeError: salt is not sugar
```



## A stacktrace is just the stack at the moment something goes wrong




## It is entirely possible that something will go wrong and it will 
## not be noticed until later. So the step where the problem actually is may
## not be in the stacktrace.

## For example: we put salt in the syrup instead of sugar and no one caught it until 
## tasting. Much harder to troubleshoot.
